{"name":"mose","body":"# What is 'mose'?\r\n'mose' is a visualization tool for iRacing car setup file. It's running as Web application on your PC. You can see the difference between two or more setup files simultaneously, quickly and visually.\r\nIn addition, mose can track the lap time marked by the setup that you want to record with it.\r\n\r\n# Concept\r\nFor beginners, it's really tough to create good setup because they have to learn a lot of theory and also plenty of experience by their own is needed. On the other hand, there are some nice setups created by talented and/or experienced drivers on the forum week by week. That is chance to learn what difference makes different speed and/or handling of the car.\r\nmose assists this process.\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n### Comparing some setups visually\r\n![Chassis1](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/48/48429076-dfa4-474e-a40f-8c1b97baf019/e220a641-8819-48ab-b894-f14c80dcafc7/02chassis.PNG)\r\n![Chassis2](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/48/48429076-dfa4-474e-a40f-8c1b97baf019/fce8f37e-10e0-4c8f-9fab-4a8dd9be517e/03chassis2.PNG)\r\n![Chassis3](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/48/48429076-dfa4-474e-a40f-8c1b97baf019/b103c2ee-7595-41d7-879d-e4b47d4b5c9b/04tire.PNG)\r\n### Data view\r\n![Data](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/48/48429076-dfa4-474e-a40f-8c1b97baf019/f4ff9355-d8b4-48c3-90d6-c65616c72047/dataview.png)\r\n### Lap time\r\n![Laptime](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/48/48429076-dfa4-474e-a40f-8c1b97baf019/7d3ea405-b537-4ff9-9799-c6d104cfda4f/laptimecomparison.png)\r\n### Extending session result page to import lap time\r\n![Laptime importer](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/48/48429076-dfa4-474e-a40f-8c1b97baf019/cde3e194-72ee-46fb-bb34-1161630fb643/laptimeimporter.png)\r\n\r\n# Download\r\n* [version 0.1b](https://github.com/mochablendy/mose/zipball/v0.1b)\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n1.
